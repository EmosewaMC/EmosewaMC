- Hi, I’m David Markowitz (EmosewaMC) and I am a full time student at Cabrillo College studying Computer Science.  I am graduating from UCSC in the Fall of 2024 with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
- I’m currently interested in BackEnd Engineer roles and learning oppotunities.
- I’m currently experienced in C++, Java and SQL.  Most proficient in C++.  My first contributions to production style code began in December 2021 and the language we use is C++.
- I have 2 years of coding classes and 1.5 years of backend engineering experience.  Experience varies from Reverse Engineering assembly into C, helping improve and further develop Entity-Component Systems.  Implementing a test infrastructure to make writing tests easier.  Fully modularizing build systems.  Database management and more.
- I’m looking to collaborate on server side code and gaming projects in either C++ or C#.
- You can reach me at dgmarkowitz@gmail.com or through Discord @ EmosewaMC#5642.  
- I've really been enjoying learning about OOP and am always pracing my code on either leetCode or contributing to Darkflame Universe, an almost perfect emulation of the live LEGO Universe servers!
