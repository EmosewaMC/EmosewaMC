- Hi, I’m David Markowitz (EmosewaMC) and I am a full time student at Cabrillo College studying Computer Science.  I am transfering to UCSC in the Fall of 2022 to complete my Bachelors degree.
- I’m currently interested in BackEnd Engineer roles and learning oppotunities.
- I’m currently learning C++, Java and SQL.  Most proficient in C++.  My first contributions to production style code began in December 2021 and the language we use is C++.
   I have 2 years of coding classes mainly in Java with 1 class being C++ oriented.
- I’m looking to collaborate on server side code and gaming projects in either C++ or Java.
- You can reach me at dgmarkowitz@gmail.com or through Discord @ EmosewaMC#5642.  
- I've really been enjoying learning about OOP and am always pracing my code on either leetCode or contributing to Darkflame Universe, an almost perfect emulation of the live LEGO Universe servers!
